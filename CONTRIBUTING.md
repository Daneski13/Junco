# Contributing

**Always looking for the following contributions:**

- Improving the case files and/or adding new cases see [quirks](./README.md#quirks) and [case](./README.md#case)
- Markdown files - fixing typos and grammar or adding clarity

**Wish list:**

- Fixing the switch sockets / RGB to be right side up see [quirks](./README.md#quirks) (for a revision 1.1)
- 50% Variant (no num-row)
- Portable companion keyboard. Highly portable, no rotary, 50% Choc hot-swap variant (bluetooth, ZMK)

Other types of contributions that align with goals similar to those expressed in [design philosophy](./README.md#philosophy) are welcome, but please open an issue first to discuss.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Daneski13/Junco.git
```

Make sure you have the latest version of [KiCad](https://kicad.org/download/) installed if you want to make changes to the PCB. If you just want to make changes to the case files, you may use the software of your choice, but a free option would be preferred.

## Making Changes

Make your changes in a new branch unless you are fixing markdown files. If you are only changing markdown files, you may make your changes on the `main` branch.

Update the README / documentation with the details of your changes as necessary.

Larger changes should have a PR open during development to allow for discussion and feedback.
